\title{\code{\link{readPlateData}} parses data files in CSV, as exported by
the plate reader software. Header IDs in the data file should match with 
IDs in the plate map, see \code{link{readPlateMap}}. Pre-defined read-in
functions exist for a couple of plate-readers.}
\usage{
readPlateData(files, type, data.ids, skip = 0, sep = "\\t", dec = ".",
  verb = TRUE, interpolate = TRUE, time.conversion, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{list of one or more data files}

\item{type}{pre-defined formats, as exported from platereaders; currently
for BMG Optima/Mars, ('BMG') and Synergy Mx ('Synergy').}

\item{data.ids}{an optional sub-selection of data types in the input file,
as a list of strings}

\item{skip}{lines to skip from the data file}

\item{sep}{column separator, as in read.table}

\item{dec}{decimal operator used in the data file}

\item{verb}{print messages if true}

\item{interpolate}{if true a master time, the average time between distinct
measurements of one timepoint, is calculated and all values are interpolated
to this mastertime. This is currently obligatory for further processing.}
}
\value{
a list of distinct measurement time-courses from one plate
}

The original data is all interpolated to a common/average 'master' time
